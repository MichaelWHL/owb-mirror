        Bug 21402: Add a clip in RenderView::layout to avoid doing offscreen paint

        We now add a clip to the viewPort size and offset. In our testing,
        this can be a good win on embedded devices.

        Ticket #300: Add some probes to evaluate the OWB spends in each engine parts

        Add the TimeCounter class that implements two methods startCounting and stopCounting.
        It can handle recursive call for simplicity of use.

        The timing can be enabled with the BENCH_LOAD_TIME option. 

        **** Bear in mind that the results may overlap between the different parts and that
         there may be some overhead while timing. The best use is to use them as qualitative
         information on how the time is spend in the engine. ****
